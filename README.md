Problem statement

Assessment Requirements:

Coding Assessment:

1. Code must be published in Github with a link we can access (use public repo).
2. Code must compile with some effort on unit tests, doesn't have to be 100%, but it shouldn't be 0%.
3. Here is the application we want to build for the interview,
4. Please code this with Java
5. Adding a persistence layer will be cumbersome, so just store the data in your current session/in memory.


App to be coded:

1. I want to board a train from London to France. The train ticket will cost $20.
2. Create API where you can submit a purchase for a ticket. Details included in the receipt are:
